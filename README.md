# Evolutionary Design - Training

_WIP, What we are doing concretly_.

As you may know, writing code consists mostly of two sub-activities which are:

- adding *behavior* and;
- adding *design*.

Most of the time, we are writing code doing both activities at the same time, differentiating them, only up to a certain point but never completly.

We mix **deductive** and **inductive** reasoning. _why this is a problem_.

This methodoloy helps writing better source code by focusing only on the **inductive approach**.

## More on this repository
This repository is my exploration on this methodology.

It contains tries, failures, errors and notes. It is, by no means, made to be easily readable or accessible. It's more a draft and a proof a work that the methodology works and can be used.

This example uses a kind of a bingo game. [Advent of Code's day 4: Giant Squid](https://adventofcode.com/2021/day/4) is the full problem description.

# Resources
In it's [TDD as If You Meant It](https://cumulative-hypotheses.org/2011/08/30/tdd-as-if-you-meant-it/) article, Keith Braithwaite explains how TDD is often misused and provides a way of doing using other steps that does not lead to the same mistakes. It's like a first step towards evolutionary design as a discipline.

Cyrille Martaire's blog article [Adrian Bolboaca on Evolutionary Design](https://medium.com/@cyrillemartraire/adrian-bolboaca-on-evolutionary-design-inductive-vs-deductive-approaches-a7cead4bdd20) summarizes Adrian Bolboaca meetup on Evolutionary Design. It's a great resource to better understand inductive and deductive approaches as well as having a glimpse of the methodology processes themselves.

 Bob Martin's blog article [Transformation Priority Premise](https://blog.cleancoder.com/uncle-bob/2013/05/27/TheTransformationPriorityPremise.html) introduces transformations (changes in code that occur outside of the refactoring part) and show how it can help better conduct changes.

Adrian Bolboaca's slides [Evolutionary Design - Refactoring Heuristics](https://www.slideshare.net/adibolb/evolutionary-design-refactoring-heuristics) exposes its reflexion on code evolution and showcases some refactoring pattern.
